# Physics-Innovative-Society
PIns (Physics Innovative Society) is a non-profit academic infrastructure designed to connect physics students and professors across universities through structured, secure research collaboration. 


This website will provide a faculty-verified enivornment where students and physicists can:

- Share research interests and technical skills
- Ask and answer research-level questions
- Collaborate on open source physics projects
- Seek mentorship across institutions
- Post university-specific reserach opportunities
- Discuss innovative physics ideas in a structured environment

PInS is not made to replace anything. Instead, it serves as a secure academic layer that enables structured interaction between verified physics researchers.
